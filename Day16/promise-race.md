`Promise.race` is a JavaScript function that takes an array (or any iterable) of Promises and returns a new Promise. This new Promise settles (resolves or rejects) as soon as one of the Promises in the input array settles, whether it resolves or rejects. It essentially races the Promises against each other and returns the result of the first Promise that settles.

The syntax for `Promise.race` is as follows:

```javascript
Promise.race(iterable);
```

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- If any Promise in the `iterable` resolves (fulfills), the new Promise returned by `Promise.race` also resolves with the same value.

- If any Promise in the `iterable` rejects, the new Promise returned by `Promise.race` also rejects with the same reason.

- Once the first Promise settles (either resolves or rejects), the other Promises in the `iterable` are ignored, and their results do not affect the outcome of the new Promise.

Here's an example of using `Promise.race` to implement a timeout for a Promise:

```javascript
function timeout(ms) {
  return new Promise((_, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      reject("Timeout");
    }, ms);
  });
}

const promise = fetch("https://example.com"); // Replace with your async operation

Promise.race([promise, timeout(3000)]) // Race the fetch operation against a 3-second timeout
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response); // This will log the response if it resolves within 3 seconds
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error); // This will log "Timeout" if the fetch operation takes longer than 3 seconds
  });
```

In this example, `Promise.race` is used to race the fetch operation against a timeout Promise. If the fetch operation completes within 3 seconds, the result will be the response from the fetch. If it takes longer than 3 seconds, the timeout Promise will reject with "Timeout."
